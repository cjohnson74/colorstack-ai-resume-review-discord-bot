## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

The bot includes a comprehensive analytics system that tracks:

- **Resume Reviews**: Total number of reviews, breakdown by server and user
- **Scores**: Average scores for experiences, projects, formatting, and overall
- **API Usage**: Token consumption and estimated costs
- **User Feedback**: Ratings provided by users after receiving resume feedback

### Usage Statistics Command

Administrators can view these statistics using the `!stats` command in Discord, which displays:

- Total number of resume reviews processed
- Average scores across all resume sections
- API usage metrics and estimated costs
- User feedback ratings and satisfaction metrics

### Analytics Data Storage

Analytics data is stored in a JSON file (`analytics_data.json`) and includes:

- Daily usage metrics for tracking trends over time
- Server-specific statistics to understand usage across different communities
- User engagement metrics to identify power users
- API consumption tracking to monitor costs
- Feedback ratings to measure user satisfaction

This data helps administrators understand usage patterns and make informed decisions about bot improvements.

### Implementation Details

The analytics system is implemented in the `utils/analytics.py` file and provides:

- Persistent storage with error handling
- Atomic updates to prevent data corruption
- Weighted average calculations for accurate scoring metrics
- Cost estimation based on Claude API pricing

### Testing Analytics

The repository includes a test script (`test_analytics.py`) to verify the analytics functionality:

```bash
python test_analytics.py
```

This script:
- Creates test resume review entries
- Simulates API usage tracking
- Records sample feedback ratings
- Generates a usage report
- Verifies that the analytics file is created correctly

Running this test is recommended after deployment to ensure the analytics system is functioning properly in your environment.
